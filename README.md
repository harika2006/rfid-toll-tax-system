# Toll Tax System Using RFID Module

## Project Overview

This project, developed under the **GE107 â€“ Tinkering Lab**, presents a functional prototype of an automated toll collection system utilizing RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. The system aims to streamline toll collection by automatically identifying vehicles via RFID tags, processing toll payments, and controlling the toll gate mechanism. The overall objective is to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of toll operations while reducing manual intervention.

## Project Plan

### 1. Simulation and Testing  
The design process began with software simulations to verify the logic and workflow of the system before hardware implementation.

### 2. Component Procurement and Assembly  
Essential components such as the RFID reader, tags, microcontroller (Arduino), motor, and other accessories were acquired and assembled on a breadboard.

### 3. Software Development  
The embedded software was developed using the Arduino IDE. It is responsible for:
- Reading RFID tag data  
- Matching it with pre-stored values  
- Controlling the gate mechanism through a motor or servo  
- Displaying messages on the LCD screen  
- Triggering a buzzer and LEDs for status indication

### 4. Hardware Integration and Testing  
The system was integrated and tested under various conditions to ensure functional correctness, reliable tag detection, smooth gate operation, and clear information display.
